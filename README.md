Backdrop-Swap: Background Replacement Tool

### Description:
Backdrop-Swap is a versatile and user-friendly tool designed to enable seamless background replacement for images. This project offers an intuitive interface for users to replace the background of any image effortlessly. 

### Key Features:

**1. Image Upload :** Users can upload two images - the target image (the one whose background they want to replace) and the new background image.

**2. Background Removal :** The tool employs advanced image segmentation techniques to automatically extract the main subject or character from the target image and create a transparent background.

**3. Resizing and Alignment :** The segmented image is resized to match the dimensions of the new background image, ensuring a perfect fit.

**4. Superimposition :** The segmented image with the transparent background is then superimposed onto the new background image, seamlessly blending the two to create a cohesive final image.

### How It Works:

**1. Image Selection :** Users select the target image and the new background image by uploading them through the user-friendly interface.

**2. Automated Segmentation :** Backdrop-Swap employs advanced image processing techniques to automatically segment the main subject from the target image, creating a precise mask.

**3. Background Replacement :** The tool superimposes the segmented subject onto the new background, ensuring a smooth transition and natural alignment using PIL.

### Benefits:

**1. Effortless Background Replacement :** Backdrop-Swap simplifies the complex process of background replacement, making it accessible to users without extensive image editing expertise.

**2. Automated Segmentation :** The tool's automated subject extraction ensures precise and accurate results, saving users time and effort.

**3. Perfect Fit :** By resizing and aligning the subject with the new background, Backdrop-Swap guarantees a visually appealing and natural-looking final image.
